I wrote this alarm clock for myself. Maybe others would like to use it.

I wanted an alarm clock that:
 - has a simple user interface
 - I can press anywhere on the screen to stop the alarm
 - No snooze feature
 - Power Nap feature
 - Able to set recurring alarms for days of the week.
 
The application has been tested on my phone. I don't guarantee that it works on 
your phone.
